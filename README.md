# UART-Communication-Protocol-on-FPGA
This repository contains the implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) Communication Protocol and Corrector Functions on an FPGA board. The project was developed as part of the ECN-300 Lab-Based Project during my 3rd year at IIT Roorkee, focusing on real-time serial data transmission using a Basys3 FPGA board.
